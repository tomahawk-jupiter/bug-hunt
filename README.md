# Bug Hunt

An idea for a playful take on darkmode. The lights are out and you have just your flashlight to find your way in the dark... and you are not alone!

The cockroaches will scurry away from the light.

NOTE: You should be able to move the light around on touchscreen too although I only tried this in dev tools.
